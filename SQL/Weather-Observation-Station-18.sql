/*Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

 a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.*/

#The distance between two points measured along axes at right angles. In a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2, y2), it is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.
